# Key Benefits of Spring Cloud
1. **Flexibility:** Provides tools to address many challenges of building and deploying microservices.
2. **Scalability:** Helps you build systems that can scale easily in cloud environments.
3. **Resilience:** Adds fault tolerance and resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries, etc.) to prevent system-wide failures.
4. **Security:** Simplifies securing microservices and handling authentication/authorization across distributed systems.
5. **Cloud-Ready:** Designed with cloud platforms in mind, making it ideal for cloud-native applications.
