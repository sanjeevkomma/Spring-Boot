# 🛠️ Using Spring Boot Migrator (spring-boot-migrator)

The **Spring Boot Migrator (`spring-boot-migrator`)** is a CLI tool that helps automate parts of the migration from older versions of Spring Boot (e.g., 2.x) to newer ones (e.g., 3.x or 3.2.x), including **Jakarta namespace migration**, **dependency upgrades**, and more.

---

## ✅ What It Does
- Suggests and applies migration recipes
- Helps migrate:
  - From Spring Boot 2.x to 3.x
  - From Java EE to Jakarta EE
- Can modify code (e.g., change imports), `pom.xml`, or `build.gradle`
- Reports issues and recommended changes

---

## 🚀 How to Use Spring Boot Migrator

### 🔧 1. Install Prerequisites
- Java 17+ (required for Spring Boot 3+)
- Git (used internally by the tool)
- Gradle or Maven build system
- Your Spring Boot project should be under Git version control

---

### 📦 2. Download the CLI Tool

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-migrator.git
cd spring-boot-migrator
./gradlew build
```

> Executable will be located at:  
> `cli/build/install/spring-boot-migrator/bin/spring-boot-migrator`

---

### 🏃 3. Run the Migrator on Your Project

```bash
./cli/build/install/spring-boot-migrator/bin/spring-boot-migrator run \
  --recipe migrate-to-spring-boot-3 \
  --target-dir /path/to/your/project
```

You can also run multiple recipes:

```bash
--recipe migrate-to-spring-boot-3,java-ee-to-jakarta
```

---

### 📄 4. Supported Recipes

| Recipe | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `migrate-to-spring-boot-3` | Upgrade Spring Boot version & update APIs |
| `java-ee-to-jakarta` | Replace javax.* with jakarta.* |
| `migrate-to-spring-boot-2.7` | Optional step before jumping to 3.x |
| `use-parameterized-scheduler` | Fix scheduled method parameters |
| `fix-circular-dependencies` | Detect circular bean dependencies |

---

### 📂 5. Output

- Migrator applies changes directly (backed by Git)
- You can **review diffs**:

```bash
git diff
```

- Test your application after migration

---

### 🧪 6. Test After Migration

```bash
./gradlew clean build
# or
mvn clean install
```

- Fix remaining breaking changes manually (e.g., Spring Security 6)

---

## 🔁 Best Practices

- 💡 Always **run in a new Git branch**
- 💡 Review migration guide from Spring docs:  
  [Spring Boot 3.2 Migration Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/)

---

## 📘 Optional: Use in IDE

You can also apply migration recipes programmatically using the **OpenRewrite plugin**, which powers the Spring Boot Migrator behind the scenes.
