# Inception Call Framework ‚Äì Spring Upgrade & Thrift Migration

## ‚úÖ Objective

Plan the upgrade and migration of:
- 5 services: Spring Boot Upgrade
- 4 libraries: Spring Upgrade
- 7 services: Spring Upgrade + Thrift to REST Migration

---

## 1. üîç Discovery and Scope Definition

### Services (5) ‚Äì Spring Boot Upgrade
- What is the current Spring Boot version?
- Are there compatibility issues with dependencies?
- Any embedded server or cloud-specific setup?

### Libraries (4) ‚Äì Spring Upgrade
- Are these internal shared libraries?
- Are they used by other services?
- Are deprecated Spring APIs in use?

### Services (7) ‚Äì Thrift + Spring Upgrade
- What protocols are used with Thrift (HTTP/TCP)?
- Are clients still depending on Thrift?
- Can we run dual-mode (Thrift + REST) temporarily?

---

## 2. üì¶ Technical Assessment Checklist

### For All Services & Libraries
- Java version compatibility
- Spring Boot version delta
- Jakarta EE namespace upgrade
- Deprecated configurations and annotations
- Security layer changes (e.g., `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`)

### For Thrift to REST Migration
- Thrift schema and interface inventory
- Determine service contracts
- Define backward compatibility strategy

## 3. üß± Architecture Planning

| Component         | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| REST API Design   | Based on existing Thrift methods               |
| DTO Layer         | Convert Thrift structs to Java DTOs            |
| Exception Mapping | Use `@ControllerAdvice` for REST error handling|
| Swagger/OpenAPI   | Generate REST docs                             |
| Shared Libraries  | Refactor for compatibility with new Spring     |

---

## 4. üìÖ Project Plan Structure

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
- Inventory and dependency mapping
- Compatibility matrix
- Blocker identification

### Phase 2: Spring Boot Upgrade
- Upgrade code and dependencies
- Refactor deprecated APIs
- Regression testing

### Phase 3: Thrift to REST Migration
- Map Thrift interfaces to REST
- Create REST endpoints and DTOs
- Update downstream integrations
- Test REST APIs

### Phase 4: QA & Deployment
- End-to-end validation
- CI/CD integration
- Release and monitoring

## 5. üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Frameworks

| Purpose                | Tool                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Spring Migration       | `spring-boot-migrator`, OpenRewrite |
| Thrift Migration       | Thrift compiler, custom parsers     |
| Testing                | JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers     |
| Documentation          | Swagger UI, springdoc-openapi       |
| CI/CD                  | GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI  |
| Observability          | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK             |

---

## 6. üìã Client Discussion Template

### Goals
- Confirm services and libraries involved
- Validate current vs. target architecture
- Confirm external consumers and dependencies
- Agree on migration strategy and milestones

### Questions to Ask
- Are there any release freeze periods?
- Can we temporarily freeze feature development?
- What existing testing coverage/tools exist?
- Are there legacy clients using Thrift?

## 7. üöÄ Migration Strategy Options

| Strategy         | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Big Bang         | Replace Thrift entirely (risky, fast)           |
| Strangler Pattern| Gradually replace Thrift endpoints              |
| Dual Mode        | Support both Thrift and REST during transition  |
