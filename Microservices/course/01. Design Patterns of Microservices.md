# Design Patterns of Microservices
|S.No | #Pattern  | #Intent | #TechStack|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |:--- |
|1 | Aggregator | Collects releated items of data and displays them based on DRY principle(Don't Repeat Yourself) | |
| 2| API Gateway | 1. It can convert the protocol request from one type to other <br>2. API gateway acts as an entry point to forward the client requests to appropriate microservices  | |
|3 | Chained or Chain of Responsibility |1. Prodcues a single output which is a combination of multiple chained outputs <br>2. Use synchronous HTTP request or response for messaging  | |
| 4| Asynchronous Messaging |All the services can communicate each other, but they do not have to communicate with each other sequentially  | |
| 5| Database or Shared Database | Database per service / Shared database | |
|6 | Event Sourcing | 1. Creates events regarding the changes in the application state <br>2. used to distribute events and data across micro services in an asynchronous way| |
| 7| Branch | In this design pattern, simultaneously process the requests & responses from two or more independant microservices  | |
| 8| Command Query Responsibility Segregator(CQRS) | The application is divided into 2 parts: Command & Query <br>1. Command part handles all the requests related to CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE <br>2. Query part handles Materialized views  | |
|9 | Circuit Breaker | It used to stop the process of request & response if a service is not working |Spring Cloud Netflix Hystrix,Spring Boot resilience4j -- fault tolerance method,re-try method |
|10 | Decomposition | Decomposition of Applications according to <br>1) sub-domains of application <br>2) Business capability <br>3) Strangler or Vine pattern| |
|11 | Saga Orchestration Design Pattern | Sagas manage long-lived transactions or workflows in a distributed system.<br> A saga consists of a sequence of local transactions, where each local transaction updates the state of a single service.<br> If a failure occurs, the saga can be compensated by executing reverse actions to keep the system consistent.<br> Event-driven architectures often use this pattern| [How to implement SAGA design pattern in Spring Boot?](https://fullstackdeveloper.guru/2023/05/11/how-to-implement-saga-design-pattern-in-spring-boot/)|
|12 | Saga Choreography Design Pattern | In contrast to the Saga Pattern, which relies on a centralized orchestrator ( coordinator ), the Saga Choreography Pattern uses event-driven communication between services to coordinate the saga's steps.<br> Services communicate through events to take appropriate actions without a central coordinator| [How to use Saga Pattern with Spring Boot?](https://medium.com/codex/how-to-use-saga-pattern-with-spring-boot-67c3428810f1)|
|13 | Retry Pattern | Microservices often interact with various external services, and failures are common in distributed environments.<br> The Retry Pattern allows you to handle transient failures gracefully by automatically retrying failed operations.| |
|14 | Service Registry Pattern | A service registry is a centralized component that keeps track of all the microservices instances available in the system.<br> The client-side load balancing and service discovery can be achieved by using a Service Registry Pattern.<br> Netflix Eureka is a popular implementation of this pattern.| |
|15 | Bulkhead Pattern | The Bulkhead Pattern prevents a failure in one part of a system from affecting other parts.<br> It segregates the components into different execution pools to isolate resources and limit the impact of failures.<br> Netflix Hystrix provides support for implementing the Bulkhead Pattern.| |

# To Read
# Saga Pattern
* The Saga Pattern relies on a centralized coordinator (or orchestrator) to manage the overall sequence of steps in a distributed transaction. The central coordinator is responsible for initiating and coordinating the different services involved in the saga. It communicates with each service, instructing them to perform their local transactions or actions and keeps track of the progress. If a failure occurs at any step, the central coordinator is responsible for handling compensating actions to maintain the consistency of the system
# Saga Choreography Pattern
* In contrast, the Saga Choreography Pattern uses decentralized coordination and event-driven communication between services to manage the saga. Instead of having a central coordinator, each service involved in the saga is responsible for managing its part of the workflow and emitting events to signal the progress or completion of its local transaction. Other services listen to these events and respond accordingly.
# Which one to use either Saga Pattern or Saga Choreography Pattern ?
* In summary, the choice between the Saga Pattern and the Saga Choreography Pattern depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application. The Saga Pattern provides a more centralized and controlled approach, while the Saga Choreography Pattern offers a more decentralized and event-driven coordination. Both patterns have their strengths and weaknesses, and the decision should consider factors such as system complexity, scalability needs, and the level of decoupling desired between services.
