# To Read
* The @ControllerAdvice is an annotation, to handle the exceptions globally
* The @ExceptionHandler is an annotation used to handle the specific exceptions and sending the custom responses to the client

# Handling exceptions in distributed systems in Spring Boot microservices
# 1. Global Exception Handling in each service
* Use **@ControllerAdvice or @RestControllerAdvice** to handle exceptions globally within each microservice.
  * This ensures consistent error handling across the entire application
  * This annotation can be applied on the Class|
* **@ExceptionHandler(value = ProductNotfoundException.class)**
  * The @ExceptionHandler is an annotation used to handle the specific exceptions and sending the custom responses to the client
  * This annotation can be applied on Method
# 2. Standardized / Custom  Error Responses
* Design custom error response formats that are consistent across all microservices.
* This can help with debugging when microservices communicate with each other.
# 3. Feign Client and RestTemplate Exception Handling
* When using Feign or RestTemplate to communicate between microservices, it's important to handle exceptions that arise due to network or HTTP issues.
  * Feign provides a mechanism to create fallback methods for handling failures when a service is down or unreachable.
  * In RestTemplate, you can wrap requests with try-catch blocks and handle HttpClientErrorException and HttpServerErrorException to deal with errors from other microservices.
* When making REST calls to other microservices, use FeignClient or RestTemplate.
* You can create custom error decoders in Feign to handle exceptions coming from other services
# 4. Handling Communication Failures ( Retries, Circuit Breakers and Resilience ) 
* Communication between microservices can fail due to network issues, timeouts, or service unavailability.
* This requires proper exception handling to ensure that such failures do not cause a cascading failure
  * **Retries:** Use retry mechanisms to attempt failed requests multiple times before throwing an error.
  * **Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breaker patterns using libraries like Resilience4j or Hystrix to prevent repeated failures from propagating throughout the system.
  * Use circuit breaker patterns to gracefully handle failures in distributed systems.
  * With libraries like Resilience4j or Hystrix, you can automatically manage retries, timeouts, and fallback responses.
# 5. Log Correlation with Sleuth and Distributed Tracing
* Distributed tracing is essential in microservices to trace the flow of a request across services and correlate logs for debugging.
* Use Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin or Jaeger to propagate trace IDs and span IDs across microservices.
  * When multiple microservices interact, it is essential to trace the flow of requests and exceptions across services.
  * Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin can help with log correlation and distributed tracing
  * Sleuth will automatically inject trace IDs into logs
# 6. Message Broker Exception Handling (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
* If microservices communicate asynchronously via message brokers (like Kafka or RabbitMQ), ensure that errors in message processing are handled properly and do not break the entire message flow.
  * Use dead-letter queues (DLQs) to capture failed messages for later processing.
  * Log exceptions with enough context to debug issues.
  * Implement retries for transient errors, but ensure not to retry indefinitely for permanent errors.
# 7. API Gateway Exception Handling
* When using an API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway) in front of your microservices, the gateway should also handle exceptions and propagate meaningful error messages to clients & ensure that errors in the downstream services are handled correctly and propagated back to the client with meaningful messages.
  * Implement custom error handling in the Spring Cloud API Gateway for scenarios like service timeouts, authentication failures, and bad requests.
  * The gateway should also log errors and correlate them with the downstream services.
# 8. Monitoring and Alerting
* Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to monitor microservices, track errors, and set up alerts for critical exceptions.
  * Set up alerts for critical errors and performance bottlenecks.
  * Use dashboards to monitor the health of each microservice.
  * Ensure you capture sufficient log information for debugging distributed failures.
# 9. Graceful Shutdown and Retry Mechanism and Resource Cleanup
* Microservices should handle shutdown gracefully by cleaning up resources and completing in-flight requests before terminating.
* Implement graceful shutdown mechanisms using Spring Boot’s @PreDestroy and Spring’s lifecycle events.
* Handle exceptions gracefully during shutdown or retry scenarios to ensure that pending requests or transactions are not lost.
  * Use Spring Boot's @Retryable for retrying failed operations.
  * Implement graceful shutdown mechanisms using ApplicationListener and @PreDestroy.
