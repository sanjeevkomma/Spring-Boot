# I-REST
# To Read
* Preflight Request = A preflight request is a small request that is sent by the browser before the actual request. 
* In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request
* REST API can be synchronous and asynchronous depends on the implementation. In synchronous, client sends a request and wait for a response, while in asynchronous, client sends a request and moves ahead

| 2 | No Auth |If you select this type, Postman will not send any auth data with the request |
| 3 | API key |This is to send the Key and Value along with the API request |
| 4 | Bearer Token |This auth type allows the Authorization of requests by using an access key |
| 5 | Basic Auth |This allows users to send username and password along with the request for API login |
| 6 | Digest Auth |This is the two-point authentication of your API request. In this auth type user will send a request where the server will reply with a number that can only be used once.

| 1 | SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)  |Use SOAP when you need a strict, standardized protocol for exchanging structured information in enterprise-level applications. It's known for its strong typing and security features |
| 2 | RESTful (Representational State Transfer)  |REST is great for web services that prioritize simplicity and scalability. Use it when building public-facing APIs or when you want a stateless, resource-oriented design |
|3 | GraphQL  |GraphQL is perfect when you need flexible, client-driven APIs. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching |
| 4 | gRPC  |If you're aiming for high-performance, efficient APIs, gRPC is your go-to. It's designed for low-latency, high-throughput communication, often used in microservices architectures |
| 5 | WebSockets  |When real-time, bidirectional communication is essential (e.g., chat applications, online gaming), WebSockets shine. They maintain a continuous connection for instant data updates |
| 6 | Webhooks  |Use webhooks for event-driven systems. They allow your application to receive notifications or trigger actions when specific events occur, such as data updates or user actions |

# II-GraphQL
# To Read
What is GraphQL? Is it a replacement for the REST API?

The diagram below shows the quick comparison between REST and GraphQL.

🔹GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Meta. It provides a complete description of the data in the API and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need.

🔹GraphQL servers sit in between the client and the backend services.

🔹GraphQL can aggregate multiple REST requests into one query. GraphQL server organizes the resources in a graph.

🔹GraphQL supports queries, mutations (applying data modifications to resources), and subscriptions (receiving notifications on schema modifications).

We talked about the REST API in last week’s video and will compare REST vs. GraphQL vs. gRPC in a separate post/video.

Over to you:
1). Is GraphQL a database technology?
2). Do you recommend GraphQL? Why/why not?

# Advantages
1. GraphQL is more precise, accurate, and efficient
* To avoid data over fetching & data under fetching by REST API
2. Retrieve many resources from a single request
3. It facilitates you to deal with many databases efficiently
4. Data can be fetched using a single API call
5. Using GraphQL, you can discover the schema in the appropriate format

# Methods to improove API performance
1. Pagination:
 Implement server-side pagination to limit the amount of data transferred in a single request/response. Allow clients to request a specific page or range of data.
 Use query parameters like `page` and `pageSize` to control the pagination, and ensure your API documentation is clear on how to use it.
2. Asynchronous Logging:
 Log asynchronously to avoid introducing latency to API responses. Use a message queue or a dedicated logging service to process logs in the background.
 This decouples the logging process from the request/response cycle, improving API responsiveness.
3. Connection Pooling:
 Use connection pooling for database and other resource intensive operations. Connection pooling helps efficiently manage and reuse database connections, reducing overhead.
4. Caching:
 Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently requested data. Consider using in memory caching systems like Redis or Memcached to speed up data retrieval.
 Utilise HTTP caching headers (e.g., `CacheControl`, `ETag`) to instruct clients and intermediaries to cache responses, reducing the load on your API.
5. Load Balancing:
 Set up load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple API servers or instances. This ensures even load distribution and redundancy.
 Consider using dynamic load balancing algorithms to adapt to changing server loads.
6. Payload Compression:
 Compress API responses before sending them to clients. Use popular compression algorithms like GZIP, Brotli, or Zstandard to reduce data transfer times.
 Ensure that clients support decompression of compressed payloads.
* Remember that the effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific requirements of your API and the technologies you are using. Monitoring and performance testing are crucial to fine tune and optimise your API further. Additionally, consider using content delivery networks (CDNs) to distribute static content, and use API gateways to manage and secure your API endpoints effectively.
