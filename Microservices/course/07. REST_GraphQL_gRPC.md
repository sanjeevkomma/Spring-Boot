# I-REST
# To Read
* Preflight Request = A preflight request is a small request that is sent by the browser before the actual request. 
* In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request
* REST API can be synchronous and asynchronous depends on the implementation. In synchronous, client sends a request and wait for a response, while in asynchronous, client sends a request and moves ahead

# Terminology
* Idempotent = ( Multiple requests = Single request )
* Safe =

| 1 | Inherit auth from parent | This is the default auth type. In this, authorization type will be the same as the parent, which means whatever the auth type you selected for that collection (parent); the same auth type will be selected for the request, which is under that collection|
| 2 | No Auth |If you select this type, Postman will not send any auth data with the request |
| 3 | API key |This is to send the Key and Value along with the API request |
| 4 | Bearer Token |This auth type allows the Authorization of requests by using an access key |
| 5 | Basic Auth |This allows users to send username and password along with the request for API login |
| 6 | Digest Auth |This is the two-point authentication of your API request. In this auth type user will send a request where the server will reply with a number that can only be used once. Then the user again will send the request along with username, password, and that realm number for Authorization of the request |
| 7 | OAuth |This auth type is to access third-party API data |
| 8 | Hawk Authentication |This enables users to use partial cryptographic verification to authenticate their requests. Hawk Auth id, which is your API authentication ID value and Hawk Auth key, which is your API authentication key value, is required for Authorization under this auth type |
| 9 | AWS Signature |For Amazon Web Services requests, this auth type is used |
| 10 | NTLM Authentication (Beta) |This is the auth type for windows OS and standalone systems |
| 11 | Akamai EdgeGrid |Akamai technologies use this auth type for authorizing requests |

| 1 | Uniform interface |Once a developer becomes familiar with one of your APIs, he should be able to follow a similar approach for other APIs |
| 2 | Clientâ€“server |Servers and clients may also be replaced and developed independently, as long as the interface between them is not altered |
| 3 | Stateless | client context will not be stored on the server between requests. The client is responsible for managing the state of the application |
| 4 | Cacheable |Well-managed caching partially or completely eliminates some client-server interactions, further improving scalability and performance |
| 5 | Layered system | |
| 6 | Code on demand (optional) | |

What is GraphQL? Is it a replacement for the REST API?

The diagram below shows the quick comparison between REST and GraphQL.

ðŸ”¹GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Meta. It provides a complete description of the data in the API and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need.

ðŸ”¹GraphQL servers sit in between the client and the backend services.

ðŸ”¹GraphQL can aggregate multiple REST requests into one query. GraphQL server organizes the resources in a graph.

ðŸ”¹GraphQL supports queries, mutations (applying data modifications to resources), and subscriptions (receiving notifications on schema modifications).

We talked about the REST API in last weekâ€™s video and will compare REST vs. GraphQL vs. gRPC in a separate post/video.

Over to you:
1). Is GraphQL a database technology?
2). Do you recommend GraphQL? Why/why not?

# Advantages
1. GraphQL is more precise, accurate, and efficient
* To avoid data over fetching & data under fetching by REST API
2. Retrieve many resources from a single request
3. It facilitates you to deal with many databases efficiently
4. Data can be fetched using a single API call
5. Using GraphQL, you can discover the schema in the appropriate format
