# Definition
* The Saga design pattern is a microservices architectural pattern that helps manage distributed transactions and ensures data consistency across multiple services.
* In a distributed system, traditional transactions (like the ones handled by databases using ACID properties) are difficult to manage due to the distributed nature of services, and thatâ€™s where the Saga pattern comes in.
* It is particularly useful when each service in the system owns its own database and there is no centralized database to ensure transactional consistency.
