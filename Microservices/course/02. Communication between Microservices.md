| 1 | Synchronous communication |HTTP,REST,gRPC| In this pattern, a service calls an API that another service exposes, using a protocol such as HTTP or gRPC. This option is a synchronous messaging pattern because the caller waits for a response from the receiver|
| 2 | Asynchronous message passing |Message Brokers - MQ,Kafka| In this pattern, a service sends message without waiting for a response, and one or more services process the message asynchronously|

# Types of Communication between Microservices
# 1. Synchronous Communication
  1. REST
     * Microservices communicate using HTTP-based REST APIs.
       1. RestTemplate
       2. WebClient
          * WebClient is a reactive
          * WebClient is non-blocking client introduced in Spring WebFlux
          * WebClient is the modern replacement for RestTemplate
       3. Feign Client (if you are using Spring Cloud)
          * Feign Client is Declarative REST Client
          * Feign is an abstraction over REST-based calls provided by Spring Cloud
  2. gRPC
  3. GraphQL
# 2. Asynchronous Communication
  1. Message Queuing (Point-to-Point Communication)
     * Description: In point-to-point communication, services send messages to a queue. A message consumer receives the message from the queue and processes it. This is typically used when one service needs to send a task to another service
     * Technologies: RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Amazon SQS, Kafka (used as a message queue).
     * Use Case: An order service places an order in a queue, and the shipping service consumes and processes the order asynchronously
  2. Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)
  3. Event-Driven Architecture (Event Streaming)
  4. Choreography-Based Event Sourcing
  5. Callback Pattern
  6. Polling Pattern
  7. Streaming (Reactive Programming)
  8. WebSockets(Full-Duplex Communication)
# 3. Service Discovery and Load Balancing (Eureka and Ribbon)
* If you're using Spring Cloud Netflix for microservices, you can use Eureka for service discovery, and Ribbon for client-side load balancing
* This allows services to discover each other dynamically without hardcoding URLs
* Use service discovery with RestTemplate or FeignClient, and the service names will be resolved dynamically by Eureka
# 4. API Gateway (Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway)
* An API Gateway (like Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway) can be used as an entry point for requests, routing them to appropriate microservices.
* Spring Cloud Gateway is preferred as it's built on top of Spring WebFlux and is fully non-blocking.
# 5. Distributed Tracing with Zipkin and Sleuth




# To Read
* Because microservices are distributed and microservices communicate with each other by inter-service communication on network level. Each microservice has its own instance and process. Therefore, services must interact using an inter-service communication protocols like HTTP, gRPC or message brokers AMQP protocol

# Types of Asynchronous Communication between Microservices

| 1 | Orchestration | 1. Centralized approach for service composition<br>2. Around the Business Domain<br>3. This logic is described at a single place|
| 2 | Choreography | 1. Decentralized approach for service composition<br>2. Among the multiple Business Domains<br>3. The decision logic is distributed, with no centralized point|
