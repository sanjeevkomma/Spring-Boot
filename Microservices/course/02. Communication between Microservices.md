| 1 | Synchronous communication |HTTP,REST,gRPC| In this pattern, a service calls an API that another service exposes, using a protocol such as HTTP or gRPC. This option is a synchronous messaging pattern because the caller waits for a response from the receiver|
| 2 | Asynchronous message passing |Message Brokers - MQ,Kafka| In this pattern, a service sends message without waiting for a response, and one or more services process the message asynchronously|

# To Read
* Because microservices are distributed and microservices communicate with each other by inter-service communication on network level. Each microservice has its own instance and process. Therefore, services must interact using an inter-service communication protocols like HTTP, gRPC or message brokers AMQP protocol

| 1 | Orchestration | 1. Centralized approach for service composition<br>2. Around the Business Domain<br>3. This logic is described at a single place|
| 2 | Choreography | 1. Decentralized approach for service composition<br>2. Among the multiple Business Domains<br>3. The decision logic is distributed, with no centralized point|
| 3 | Tight Coupling | |
