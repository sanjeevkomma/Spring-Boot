# To Read
* Because microservices are distributed and microservices communicate with each other by inter-service communication on network level.
* Each microservice has its own instance and process.
* Therefore, services must interact using an inter-service communication protocols like HTTP, gRPC or message brokers AMQP protocol

# Types of Communication between Microservices
# 1. Synchronous Communication
  1. REST
     1. RestTemplate
     2. WebClient
          * WebClient is a reactive
          * WebClient is non-blocking client introduced in Spring WebFlux
          * WebClient is the modern replacement for RestTemplate
     3. FeignClient (if you are using Spring Cloud)
          * Feign Client is Declarative REST Client
          * Feign is an abstraction over REST-based calls provided by Spring Cloud
  2. gRPC
  3. GraphQL
# 2. Asynchronous Communication
  1. Message Queuing (Point-to-Point Communication)
     * **Description:**
         * In point-to-point communication, services send messages to a queue.
         * A message consumer receives the message from the queue and processes it.
         * This is typically used when one service needs to send a task to another service
         * The producer and consumer are decoupled in time, meaning the consumer can process messages at its own pace
     * **Technologies:** RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Amazon SQS, Kafka (used as a message queue)
     * **How It Works:**
         * The producer sends a message to the queue.
         * The message sits in the queue until a consumer is ready to process it.
         * Once the consumer processes the message, it acknowledges receipt and the message is removed from the queue.
     * **Use Case:** An order service places an order in a queue, and the shipping service consumes and processes the order asynchronously
     * **Code:** rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("order-queue", newOrder);
  2. Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)
     * **Description:**
         * In a pub/sub model, services (publishers) send messages to a topic or exchange, and multiple other services (subscribers) receive the messages.
         * The producer does not need to know how many consumers will receive the message.
         * It’s useful for broadcasting events to multiple services.
     * **Technologies:** Kafka, RabbitMQ (Exchange), Google Pub/Sub, Amazon SNS
     * **How It Works:**
         * The producer publishes a message to a topic.
         * Subscribers to that topic will receive the message.
         * Multiple subscribers can independently process the same message.
     * **Use Case:** A user registration event is published to a topic, and both the email notification service and the analytics service subscribe to the topic to perform their respective actions
     * **Code:** kafkaTemplate.send("user-registration-topic", userEvent);
  3. Event-Driven Architecture (Event Streaming)
     * **Description:**
         * Microservices communicate via events in an event-driven architecture.
         * In event-driven architectures, microservices publish events whenever a significant state change occurs (e.g., "order placed", "payment received"), and other microservices subscribe to these events
         * Event streams are continuous and immutable.
         * When one service performs an action (e.g., creating an order), it publishes an event, and other services react to that event.
     * **Technologies:** Apache Kafka, Event Store, Spring Cloud Stream, Amazon Kinesis
     * **How It Works:**
         * The producer microservice publishes events to an event stream.
         * Consumers subscribe to the stream to react to those events in real-time or process them at a later time.
     * **Use Case:** The payment service publishes a "payment completed" event, and the order service updates the order status based on that event
     * **Code:** kafkaTemplate.send("order-events", new OrderEvent(orderId, "ORDER_PLACED"));
  4. Saga Choreography-Based Event Sourcing
     * **Description:**
         * In choreography, services collaborate by producing and consuming events without a central orchestrator.
         * Each service performs a local action and publishes an event that triggers further actions in other services.
         * There is no central orchestrator
     * **Technologies:** Kafka, RabbitMQ, Axon Framework
     * **How It Works:**
         * Each service publishes events when it completes an action.
         * Other services subscribe to these events and act on them.
         * Events are stored, so you can reconstruct the sequence of events (Event Sourcing). 
     * **Use Case:** A payment service processes a payment and publishes a "payment completed" event. The order service then listens to this event and updates the order status to "confirmed"
  5. Callback Pattern
     * **Description:**
         * In the callback pattern, one service makes a request to another service but does not block waiting for a response.
         * The called service processes the request asynchronously and later calls back with the response. 
     * **Technologies:** HTTP with Webhooks, gRPC with callbacks, RabbitMQ with acknowledgment
     * **How It Works:**
         * The producer sends a request and provides a callback URL or mechanism.
         * The consumer processes the request and calls back to the producer when done.
     * **Use Case:** An order service requests payment processing and continues. Once the payment service completes the transaction, it notifies the order service via a callback URL.
  6. Polling Pattern
     * **Description:**
         * A microservice can periodically check for updates from another service by polling it at regular intervals.
         * This is often used when event-driven solutions are not feasible
     * **Technologies:** HTTP Polling, JMS, Kafka Consumer Groups
     * **How It Works:**
         * The consumer repeatedly checks (polls) the producer for new messages or events at specific intervals
     * **Use Case:** A report generation service polls the data aggregation service for new data at fixed intervals.
  7. Streaming (Reactive Programming)
     * **Description:**
         * Reactive streams allow data to be consumed in real-time as it is produced.
         * This pattern can be implemented using non-blocking streams where microservices react to changes in the data.
     * **Technologies:** Project Reactor, RxJava, Spring WebFlux, Kafka Streams
     * **How It Works:**
         * A stream of data is generated continuously.
         * Consumers subscribe to the stream and react to the incoming data asynchronously.
     * **Use Case:** A stock trading application where stock prices are streamed and consumers (traders) receive real-time price updates to trigger actions.
     * **Code:** public Flux<StockPrice> getStockPrices()
  8. WebSockets(Full-Duplex Communication)
     * **Description:**
         * WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
         * This allows real-time asynchronous communication between client and server.
     * **Technologies:** Spring WebSocket, Socket.IO
     * **How It Works:**
         * WebSockets establish a long-lived connection between the client and server
         * Both parties can send data to each other asynchronously.
      * **Use Case:** A chat application where messages are instantly sent to all connected clients in real time.
# 3. Service Discovery and Load Balancing (Eureka and Ribbon)
* If you're using Spring Cloud Netflix for microservices, you can use Eureka for service discovery, and Ribbon for client-side load balancing
* This allows services to discover each other dynamically without hardcoding URLs
* Use service discovery with RestTemplate or FeignClient, and the service names will be resolved dynamically by Eureka
# 4. API Gateway (Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway)
* An API Gateway (like Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway) can be used as an entry point for requests, routing them to appropriate microservices.
* Spring Cloud Gateway is preferred as it's built on top of Spring WebFlux and is fully non-blocking.
# 5. Distributed Tracing with Zipkin and Sleuth

# Choosing the Right Type
* **Point-to-point** communication is useful when there is a clear sender and receiver (e.g., order processing).
* **Pub/Sub** or **Event-driven architectures** are ideal for broadcasting events to multiple services (e.g., user registration triggering notifications and logging).
* **Message Queuing** can handle load balancing by distributing messages across multiple consumers.
* **Event Sourcing** and **Choreography** work well in complex, distributed systems where you need traceability of every event.
* The best choice depends on the use case, system requirements (latency, fault tolerance, etc.), and the nature of the communication flow.


# Synchronous vs Asynchronous
|#Feature| #Synchronous  | #Asynchronous |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Interaction Pattern | Request/Response | Event-driven or message-based|
| Communication Style | Blocking (waiting for a response) | Non-blocking (doesn’t wait)|
| Latency Sensitivity | High, as services wait for responses | Low, as responses are handled later|
| Coupling | Tightly coupled services | Loosely coupled services|
| Resilience | Lower, since one service failure may block others | Higher, failures are isolated|
| Scalability | Limited by response times | Highly scalable, since services operate independently|
| Use Case | Real-time, transactional processes | Event-driven systems, broadcasting|
| Examples | REST, gRPC, GraphQL | Kafka, RabbitMQ, WebSockets|

# Choosing Between Synchronous and Asynchronous
* **When to use Synchronous:**
    * Real-time communication is required
    * A response is needed immediately (e.g., payment confirmation).
    * For small, lightweight service interactions.
* **When to use Asynchronous:**
    * High scalability is required.
    * Services need to be decoupled.
    * Event-driven workflows are involved (e.g., order processing pipelines, notifications).
    * You need to prevent cascading failures by ensuring one service's unavailability doesn't affect others.
 
# Hybrid Approaches
* In a real-world microservices architecture, it's common to use both synchronous and asynchronous communication, depending on the use case. For example:
  * Use REST for user-to-service interactions.
  * Use message queues or event streaming for inter-service communication where services need to work independently
* The choice between synchronous and asynchronous communication depends on the specific needs for latency, fault tolerance, and service coupling in your architecture.
