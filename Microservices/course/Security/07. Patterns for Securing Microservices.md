# 1. Authentication and Authorization Patterns
   * **OAuth2/OpenID Connect:** Use token-based authentication for secure and scalable identity management.
   * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign permissions based on roles (e.g., Admin, User).
   * **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Define access rules based on attributes like location, device type, or time of access.
# 2. API Gateway Pattern     
* Centralize security concerns at the API Gateway:
    * Validate and verify tokens.
    * Perform rate limiting and IP filtering.
    * Enforce cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policies.
# 3. Service-to-Service Security
* **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Encrypt and authenticate service-to-service communication.
* **Service Mesh:** Use tools like Istio or Linkerd to secure inter-service communication.
