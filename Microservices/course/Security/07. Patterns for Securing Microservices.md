# 1. Authentication and Authorization Patterns
   * **OAuth2/OpenID Connect:** Use token-based authentication for secure and scalable identity management.
   * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign permissions based on roles (e.g., Admin, User).
   * **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Define access rules based on attributes like location, device type, or time of access.
# 2. API Gateway Pattern     
* Centralize security concerns at the API Gateway:
    * Validate and verify tokens.
    * Perform rate limiting and IP filtering.
    * Enforce cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policies.
# 3. Service-to-Service Security
* **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Encrypt and authenticate service-to-service communication.
* **Service Mesh:** Use tools like Istio or Linkerd to secure inter-service communication.
# 4. Encryption Patterns
* **Data Encryption in Transit:** Use HTTPS/TLS to encrypt data between clients and services.
* **Data Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt databases, files, and backups.
* **Key Management:** Use dedicated key management systems (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault).
# 5. Secure Configuration Management
* Store sensitive configuration (e.g., secrets, API keys) securely using tools like:
    * HashiCorp Vault
    * AWS Secrets Manager
    * Kubernetes Secrets
# 6. Input Validation and Sanitization
* Prevent injection attacks by validating and sanitizing all user inputs:
    * Use libraries like Hibernate Validator for input validation.
    * Sanitize data before processing or storage.
# 7. Rate Limiting and Throttling
* Prevent abuse and DDoS attacks by:
    * Limiting the number of requests a user can make within a given time frame.
    * Using tools like Spring Cloud Gateway or API Gateway to enforce limits.
# 8. Network Security Patterns
* **Micro-Segmentation:** Use firewalls and network policies to restrict access between services.
* **Ingress and Egress Control:** Monitor and control inbound and outbound traffic.
* **VPN/Private Networks:** Isolate sensitive services in private networks
# 9. Auditing and Logging
* Log user actions, API requests, and authentication attempts.
* Centralize logs using ELK Stack, Splunk, or Prometheus.
* Ensure logs do not contain sensitive data like passwords or tokens
# 10. Security Testing
* Conduct automated security testing using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite.
* Perform regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
* Integrate security testing into CI/CD pipelines.
