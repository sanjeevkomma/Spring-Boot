# 1. Authentication and Authorization Patterns
   * **OAuth2/OpenID Connect:** Use token-based authentication for secure and scalable identity management.
   * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign permissions based on roles (e.g., Admin, User).
   * **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Define access rules based on attributes like location, device type, or time of access.
