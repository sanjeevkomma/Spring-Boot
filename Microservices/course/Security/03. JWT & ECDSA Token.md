* JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA

# JWT STRUCTURE
* JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are: 
1. Header : The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA
2. Payload : Payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional metadata. There are three types of claims: reserved, public, and private claims
3. Signature : To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that
