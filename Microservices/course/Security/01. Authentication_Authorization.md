|1 |HTTP Basic Authentication(Using Credentials) |1. Credentials authentication is the traditional method of using a combination of a username and password to verify a user's identity.<br>2. Users provide a unique username and a secret password that should only be known to them.<br>3.  While it's a straightforward approach, it can be vulnerable to various attacks, such as brute force and phishing, if not properly secured | |
|2 |SSH Keys |1. Secure Shell (SSH) keys provide a highly secure method for remote access to servers and systems.<br>2. This mechanism relies on a pair of cryptographic keys â€“ a public key and a private key.<br>3. The public key is stored on the server, while the private key is securely kept by the user.<br>4. Access is granted to anyone who possesses the corresponding private key, making it a robust and widely-used method for securing remote connections and managing servers | |
|3 |OAuth 2.0 |1. OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted industry-standard protocol used for both authentication and authorization in web and mobile applications.<br>2. It allows users to grant a third-party application limited access to their resources, such as social media profiles or cloud data, without revealing their login credentials.<br>3. OAuth 2.0 is the foundation for Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions and ensures the security and privacy of user data in the age of interconnected apps and services.<br>4. OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted protocol for secure authorization.<br>5. Spring Boot supports OAuth 2.0 through the Spring Security OAuth project.<br>6. You can configure OAuth 2.0 using annotations like @EnableOAuth2Client and @EnableAuthorizationServer. | |
|4 |SSL Certificates |1. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates are critical for securing data transmission between a client and a server.<br>2. These certificates play a key role in establishing encrypted connections to protect sensitive information during online transactions, web browsing, and other communications.<br>3. SSL certificates authenticate the server's identity to the client and, in some cases, vice versa, ensuring that data is transmitted securely and cannot be easily intercepted by malicious actors. | |
|5 |Token-based Authentication (JWT) |1. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular choice for stateless authentication.<br> 2. Clients obtain a token after successful authentication, and this token is sent with each subsequent request.<br> 3. Spring Boot supports JWT-based authentication through libraries like Spring Security and third-party dependencies like jjwt | |
|6 |Custom Authentication Providers |1. Spring Security allows you to implement custom authentication providers.<br>2. You can create your own authentication logic by implementing AuthenticationProvider interface. | |
|7 |OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect |1. OpenID Connect is an identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0, providing authentication capabilities.<br>2. It allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.<br>3. It's commonly used for single sign-on (SSO) scenarios | |
|8 |API Keys |1. API keys are simple tokens that clients include in their requests to authenticate themselves.<br>2. This method is often used for third-party integrations.<br>3. API keys should be kept confidential, and developers need to manage and rotate them securely | |
|9 |Bearer Token Authentication |1. Bearer token authentication involves sending a token (such as a JWT) in the Authorization header of the HTTP request.<br>2. Servers validate the token and grant access based on its validity | |
|10 |Session-Based Authentication |1. While more common in traditional web applications, session-based authentication involves creating and maintaining a session after a user logs in.<br>2. The server sends a session identifier, usually stored in a cookie, with each subsequent request | |
|11 |LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) |1. LDAP is often used in enterprise settings for user authentication.<br>2. It involves querying a directory service for user credentials | |
|12 |Biometric Authentication |With the increasing prevalence of biometric technologies, some APIs use fingerprint scans, facial recognition, or other biometric data for authentication | |

|1 |Add Spring Security Dependency |In your pom.xml file, add the Spring Security dependency | |
|2 |Configure Security |Create a configuration class that extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter to configure security settings | |
|3 |Secure Endpoints | | |
|4 |JWT Token-Token in Headers  |JSON Web Tokens can be used to encode information in a token, which is then included in the Authorization header. It provides a compact and self-contained way to transmit information between parties | |
|5 |OAuth 2.0 - Bearer Token  |OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted framework for authentication and authorization. The most common method is using a bearer token. The client obtains a token from the authorization server and includes it in the Authorization header of each request | |
|6 |API Keys - API Key in Headers  |Clients are assigned API keys that they include in the headers of their requests. This method is straightforward but may lack some of the advanced features provided by OAuth 2.0 | |
|7 |Basic Authentication - Username and Password  |Basic Authentication involves sending a Base64-encoded username and password in the Authorization header. However, this method is less secure compared to token-based approaches | |
|8 |HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) - Signing Requests  |HMAC involves hashing the request data with a secret key, and the resulting hash is included in the request. The server can then verify the authenticity of the request by recomputing the hash on its side | |
|9 |OpenID Connect - Identity Layer on Top of OAuth 2.0  |OpenID Connect is an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0. It allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server | |
|10 |Bearer Tokens with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) - Enhanced Security for Mobile and Single-Page Applications  | PKCE is an extension to OAuth 2.0 that adds a security layer when using OAuth in mobile and single-page applications. | |
|11 |Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Fine-Grained Access Control  |RBAC involves assigning specific roles to users or clients, and the API server checks the role before granting access to a resource | |
|12 |Client Certificates - Mutual TLS (Transport Layer Security)  |Both the client and the server authenticate each other by presenting their digital certificates. This method is particularly useful in highly secure environments | |
