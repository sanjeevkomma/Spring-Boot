|1 |Basic Authentication(Using Credentials) |1. Credentials authentication is the traditional method of using a combination of a username and password to verify a user's identity.<br>2. Users provide a unique username and a secret password that should only be known to them.<br>3.  While it's a straightforward approach, it can be vulnerable to various attacks, such as brute force and phishing, if not properly secured | |
|2 |SSH Keys |1. Secure Shell (SSH) keys provide a highly secure method for remote access to servers and systems.<br>2. This mechanism relies on a pair of cryptographic keys â€“ a public key and a private key.<br>3. The public key is stored on the server, while the private key is securely kept by the user.<br>4. Access is granted to anyone who possesses the corresponding private key, making it a robust and widely-used method for securing remote connections and managing servers | |
|3 |OAuth 2.0 |1. OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted industry-standard protocol used for both authentication and authorization in web and mobile applications.<br>2. It allows users to grant a third-party application limited access to their resources, such as social media profiles or cloud data, without revealing their login credentials.<br>3. OAuth 2.0 is the foundation for Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions and ensures the security and privacy of user data in the age of interconnected apps and services.<br>4. OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted protocol for secure authorization.<br>5. Spring Boot supports OAuth 2.0 through the Spring Security OAuth project.<br>6. You can configure OAuth 2.0 using annotations like @EnableOAuth2Client and @EnableAuthorizationServer. | |
|4 |SSL Certificates |1. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates are critical for securing data transmission between a client and a server.<br>2. These certificates play a key role in establishing encrypted connections to protect sensitive information during online transactions, web browsing, and other communications.<br>3. SSL certificates authenticate the server's identity to the client and, in some cases, vice versa, ensuring that data is transmitted securely and cannot be easily intercepted by malicious actors. | |
|5 |Token-based Authentication (JWT) |1. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular choice for stateless authentication.<br> 2. Clients obtain a token after successful authentication, and this token is sent with each subsequent request.<br> 3. Spring Boot supports JWT-based authentication through libraries like Spring Security and third-party dependencies like jjwt |CCCC |
