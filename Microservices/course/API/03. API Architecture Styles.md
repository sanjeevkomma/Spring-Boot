|SNo| #API Architecture Style  | ##Intent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)  |Use SOAP when you need a strict, standardized protocol for exchanging structured information in enterprise-level applications. It's known for its strong typing and security features |
| 2 | RESTful (Representational State Transfer)  |REST is great for web services that prioritize simplicity and scalability. Use it when building public-facing APIs or when you want a stateless, resource-oriented design |
|3 | GraphQL  |GraphQL is perfect when you need flexible, client-driven APIs. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching |
| 4 | gRPC  |If you're aiming for high-performance, efficient APIs, gRPC is your go-to. It's designed for low-latency, high-throughput communication, often used in microservices architectures |
| 5 | WebSockets  |When real-time, bidirectional communication is essential (e.g., chat applications, online gaming), WebSockets shine. They maintain a continuous connection for instant data updates |
| 6 | Webhooks  |Use webhooks for event-driven systems. They allow your application to receive notifications or trigger actions when specific events occur, such as data updates or user actions |
