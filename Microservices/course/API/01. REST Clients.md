# HTTP Clients
# 1. RestTemplate( org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate )
* **Description:**
    * RestTemplate is a synchronous HTTP client that has been part of Spring Framework for a long time.
    * Itâ€™s simple to use but has been gradually deprecated in favor of more modern solutions like WebClient
* **Features:**
    * Simple, blocking HTTP client for RESTful APIs.
    * Supports common HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
    * Supports various message converters (JSON, XML).
    * Works well for traditional Spring MVC applications.
* **Pros:**
    * Very easy to use for simple HTTP requests.
    * Good for basic synchronous/blocking HTTP calls.
    * Well-supported in legacy Spring applications.
* **Cons:**
    * **Deprecated**: Officially deprecated in favor of WebClient (as of Spring 5)
    * Not as flexible or feature-rich as WebClient or Feign
* **Code:**
    * RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    * String response = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:8080/api/orders", String.class);
# 2. FeignClient
* **Description:**
    * Feign is a declarative HTTP client, integrated with Spring Cloud, that allows you to define REST clients using annotations.
    * It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests, especially in distributed microservice architectures.
* **Features:**
    * Declarative style, focusing on interface definitions rather than imperative code.
    * Supports load balancing (with Ribbon or Spring Cloud LoadBalancer) and circuit breakers (Hystrix/Resilience4j).
    * Reduces boilerplate code for making HTTP calls.
* **Pros:**
    * Very easy to integrate and use in microservices, especially with Spring Cloud
    * Declarative, type-safe HTTP client that simplifies remote calls.
    * Built-in support for retries, timeouts, and load balancing
* **Cons:**
    * Can be less flexible than WebClient in handling complex HTTP scenarios
    * Not ideal for fine-tuned control over requests and responses
    * Blocking and synchronous by default
* **Code:**
    * @FeignClient(name = "order-service")
# 3. WebClient ( org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient )
* **Description:**
    * WebClient is part of Springâ€™s WebFlux module and supports both synchronous and asynchronous (reactive) communication.
    * Itâ€™s a more modern and versatile alternative to RestTemplate.
* **Features:**
    * Non-blocking, reactive programming model (can also be used in a blocking manner)
    * Supports streaming responses
    * Works with both Mono (single response) and Flux (stream of responses)
    * Suitable for high-concurrency applications
    * Richer API with support for filters, timeouts, retry mechanisms, etc
* **Pros:**
    * Supports asynchronous non-blocking requests, making it more scalable for reactive applications
    * More powerful and flexible than RestTemplate
    * Allows full control over headers, request types, and responses.
    * Integrated with Spring WebFlux and Reactor for reactive streams.
* **Cons:**
    * Overkill for simple blocking HTTP calls
    * More complex API than RestTemplate for simple use cases
* **Code:**
    * WebClient webClient = WebClient.create("http://localhost:8080");
    * Mono<String> response = webClient.get().uri("/api/orders").retrieve().bodyToMono(String.class);
    * response.subscribe(System.out::println);
# 4. HTTP Interface (Declarative HTTP Interface) ( org.springframework.web.service.annotation.HttpExchange )
* **Description:**
    *  Introduced in Spring 6, this is a declarative way to define HTTP clients similar to Feign but without external dependencies.
    *  It relies on the @HttpExchange annotation, offering a native Spring solution for declarative HTTP clients
* **Features:**
    * Similar to Feign in style, but fully integrated into the core Spring Framework.
    * Can use RestTemplate, WebClient, or RestClient as the underlying HTTP client
    * Type-safe, declarative HTTP client
* **Pros:**
    * Declarative, simple to use, and type-safe.
    * Spring-native solution, no need for Feign dependencies.
    * Flexibility to choose the underlying HTTP client (RestTemplate, WebClient, RestClient etc)
* **Cons:**
    * Relatively new, so less mature compared to Feign
    * Still synchronous by default (unless paired with a non-blocking client like WebClient)
* **Code:**
    * @HttpExchange("/api/orders")
    * @GetExchange("/{id}")
# 5. RestClient
* **Description:**
    * SSSS
* **Features:**
    * SSSS
* **Pros:**
    * SSSS
* **Cons:**
    * SSSS
