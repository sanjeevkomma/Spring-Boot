What is GraphQL? Is it a replacement for the REST API?

The diagram below shows the quick comparison between REST and GraphQL.

ðŸ”¹GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Meta. It provides a complete description of the data in the API and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need.

ðŸ”¹GraphQL servers sit in between the client and the backend services.

ðŸ”¹GraphQL can aggregate multiple REST requests into one query. GraphQL server organizes the resources in a graph.

ðŸ”¹GraphQL supports queries, mutations (applying data modifications to resources), and subscriptions (receiving notifications on schema modifications).

We talked about the REST API in last weekâ€™s video and will compare REST vs. GraphQL vs. gRPC in a separate post/video.

Over to you:
1). Is GraphQL a database technology?
2). Do you recommend GraphQL? Why/why not?

# Advantages
1. GraphQL is more precise, accurate, and efficient
* To avoid data over fetching & data under fetching by REST API
2. Retrieve many resources from a single request
3. It facilitates you to deal with many databases efficiently
4. Data can be fetched using a single API call
5. Using GraphQL, you can discover the schema in the appropriate format
