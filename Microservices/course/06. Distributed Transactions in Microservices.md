# Definition
* Distributed Transaction = A distributed transaction is a set of operations on data that is performed across two or more data repositories (especially databases)

# To Read
* Because microservices are distributed and microservices communicate with each other by inter-service communication on network level. Each microservice has its own instance and process. Therefore, services must interact using an inter-service communication protocols like HTTP, gRPC or message brokers AMQP protocol

# Patterns for distributed transactions in microservices
# 1. Saga Design Pattern
* Saga is Asynchronous and Reactive
   1. Choreography-based Saga
   2. Orchestration-based Saga
# 2. 2pc (two-phase commit)
* 2PC is Synchronous. 2PC has two phases:
  1. Prepare phase -- during this phase, all participants of the transaction prepare for commit and notify the coordinator that they are ready to complete the transaction
  2. Commit or Rollback phase -- during this phase, either a commit or a rollback command is issued by the transaction coordinator to all participants| |
# 3. Eventual Consistency with Event Sourcing
# 4. TCC (Try-Confirm/Cancel)
# 5. Compensating Transactions
