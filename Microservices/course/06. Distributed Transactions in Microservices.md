# Definition
* Distributed Transaction = A distributed transaction is a set of operations on data that is performed across two or more data repositories (especially databases)

# To Read
* Because microservices are distributed and microservices communicate with each other by inter-service communication on network level.
* Each microservice has its own instance and process.
* Therefore, services must interact using an inter-service communication protocols like HTTP, gRPC or message brokers AMQP protocol

# Patterns for distributed transactions in microservices
* In microservices architectures, handling transactions that span multiple services is a complex challenge because microservices typically maintain their own databases and cannot rely on traditional ACID transactions across distributed systems.
* This is where distributed transaction patterns come into play
# 1. Saga Design Pattern
* Saga is Asynchronous and Reactive
   1. Choreography-based Saga
   2. Orchestration-based Saga
# 2. 2pc (two-phase commit)
* The Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol is a traditional approach for distributed transactions, but it has significant drawbacks in microservices due to its complexity and performance penalties
* **How It Works:**
* In the first phase (prepare phase), the coordinator asks all services (participants) if they are ready to commit the transaction.
* If all services vote to commit, the second phase (commit phase) begins, and the coordinator sends a commit message to all participants.
* **Pros:** Ensures strong consistency
* **Cons:** Poor performance due to blocking, risk of long delays if a service is unavailable, doesn't scale well with microservices architectures.
* 2PC is Synchronous. 2PC has two phases:
  1. **Prepare phase** -- during this phase, all participants of the transaction prepare for commit and notify the coordinator that they are ready to complete the transaction
  2. **Commit or Rollback phase** -- during this phase, either a commit or a rollback command is issued by the transaction coordinator to all participants
* **Example with Spring Boot:**
    * Spring Boot doesn't directly support 2PC, but you can use tools like Atomikos or Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM) to coordinate distributed transactions with JTA (Java Transaction API).
# 3. Eventual Consistency with Event Sourcing
# 4. TCC (Try-Confirm/Cancel)
# 5. Compensating Transactions
