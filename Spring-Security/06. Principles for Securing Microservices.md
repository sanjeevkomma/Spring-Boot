# 1. Defense in Depth
* Implement multiple layers of security to minimize the risk of compromise. This includes:
    * Authentication and authorization.
    * Network security (e.g., firewalls, VPNs).
    * Data encryption at rest and in transit.
    * Application-layer security.
# 2. Least Privilege
* Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for a service or user to perform its task:
    * Limit access to sensitive resources.
    * Use fine-grained access control (RBAC/ABAC).
# 3. Zero Trust Security Model
* Assume that every request is potentially untrusted. Require verification for every request, even within internal networks:
    * Authenticate and authorize every service-to-service call.
    * Validate all inputs and outputs.
#  4. Separation of Concerns
* Use dedicated services for security-related concerns like authentication, authorization, and logging.
* Delegate responsibilities to an API Gateway or Identity Provider when possible.
# 5. Auditability and Monitoring
* Track all actions and detect malicious activities:
    * Log every request and response securely.
    * Use monitoring tools for real-time threat detection.
# 6. Resilience and Graceful Degradation
* Ensure that services can handle security failures gracefully:
    * Fail closed when security checks cannot be performed.
    * Limit cascading failures by using circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms.
# 7. Immutable Infrastructure
* Treat infrastructure and deployments as immutable:
    * Deploy changes via CI/CD pipelines.
    * Avoid making manual changes in production environments.
