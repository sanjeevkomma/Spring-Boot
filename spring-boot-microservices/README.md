# Definition

# [Microservices](https://avinetworks.com/glossary/microservice/) 
* Microservice is an architectural design for building a distributed application using containers
* They get their name because each function of the application operates as an independent service
* This architecture allows for each service to scale or update without disrupting other services in the application

# Spring Cloud 

# Microservices with Spring Cloud
# Prerequisites
* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
# To Read
* We use [Spring Cloud](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) to develop Micro Services
* [Netflix OSS](https://netflix.github.io/) components are Eureka, Hystrix, Zuul, Archaius
* Below common features / cross cutting concerns are implemented at API Gateway level
* Having Rabbit MQ in between micro services will provide Resilience. Even if the distributed service is down , all the micro services still can put the messages in Rabbit MQ and distributed server can take later.
1. Authentication
2. Autherization
3. Logging
4. Rate Limiting
5. Security
6. Monitoring
7. Resilency --- the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties
8. Service Aggregation
* http://localhost:<port>/{App-Name}/{URI}
* Zuul API Gateway uses AppName in the URL to talk to Eureka Server and find the URL of the Micro Service

# Libraries or Dependencies
  1. Spring Boot Dev Tools = Used to pick the changes with out restarting the app. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-devtools)
  2. Spring Clould Netflix Eureka = service registration and service discovery. 
  3. [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_quick_start) = centralize / store the configuration of micro services. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-config-server). bootstrap.properties can be used to link between micro service & spring cloud config server. Git local repository folder will be as part of Sping cloud config server to configure properties cetrally
  4. Spring Cloud Config Client = It connects to Spring Clould Config Server to fetch the application's configuration
  5. Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Naming Server(port:8761) = Its known as Discovery Server that registers the client services with their port numbers and IP addresses. (@EnableEurekaServer,)[maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server)
  6. Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Discovery Client = It used to register / connect to Eureka Naming Server. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client)
  7. Spring Clould Netflix Zuul API Gateway Server(port:8765) = gateway service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, analytics,logging. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-netflix-zuul)
  8. Spring Cloud Netflix Ribbon = client side load balancer. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon)
  9. Spring Cloud Open Feign = declarative REST client / easier REST Client. ( @EnableFeignClients, @FeignClient )[maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-openfeign)
  10. [Spring Cloud Netflix Hystrix](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix) = latency and fault tolerance. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix). [Hystrix Circuit Breaker Pattern Example](https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-cloud/spring-hystrix-circuit-breaker-tutorial/#what-is-circuit-breaker)
  11. Spring Cloud Netflix Sleuth = Sleuth will assign unique id to the request for tracing the request across the componenets. Each micro service will put the logs into Rabbit MQ & Zipkin Server will listen to this Rabbit MQ for logs. Distributed tracing via logs. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin)
  12. Spring Cloud Netflix Zipkin Distributed Tracing Server(port:9411) = It will centralize all the logs of each component into one place(centralized Zipkin dashboard). Distributed tracing system with request visualization & request monitoring. Zipkin Server and ELK Stack both will do the same for centralizing the logs into dashboard. Zipkin server is connected to database. [zipkin server quickstart](https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart)
  13. [Spring Cloud Gateway Server](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway) = [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-gateway-server)
  14. [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/html/) = It provides route to APIs and cross cutting concerns such as security,  monitoring, metrics and resiliency to APIs. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-gateway)
  15. [Spring Cloud â€“ Bootstrapping](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-bootstrapping) = Used to load properties from external sources(for ex : XXX.properties) into bootstrap.properties. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap)
  16. [Spring Boot Actuator](https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-boot-actuator) =  Used to monitor the health and manage the Spring Boot application. http://localhost:8080/actuator/health. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-actuator)
  17. [Spring Cloud Bus](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-bus/reference/html/) = It uses Kafka or Rabbit MQ(AMQP protocol) to update the central configuration changes to all micro services in the application.[spring cloud bus maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp),[spring rabbit maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.amqp/spring-rabbit)
  18. [Spring web flux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux) = Reactive approach[Spring Webflux: Getting started](https://dzone.com/articles/spring-webflux-getting-started)
  19. Spring Cloud Load Balancer = Sping Clould Eureka Client internally has load balancer dependant for client side load balancing. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client)
  20. Spring Cloud API Gateway = It uses to route APIs and provide cross cutting concerns such as security, monitoring & resilency. Gateway Server talks to Eureka Server for app name. [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-gateway)
  21. Spring Boot resilience4j = fault tolerance method,re-try method. [resilience4j](https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/getting-started-3)
