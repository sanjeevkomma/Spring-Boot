| 1 | Uniform interface |Once a developer becomes familiar with one of your APIs, he should be able to follow a similar approach for other APIs |
| 2 | Clientâ€“server |Servers and clients may also be replaced and developed independently, as long as the interface between them is not altered |
| 3 | Stateless |No client context shall be stored on the server between requests. The client is responsible for managing the state of the application |
| 4 | Cacheable |Well-managed caching partially or completely eliminates some client-server interactions, further improving scalability and performance |
| 5 | Layered system | |
| 6 | Code on demand (optional) | |
