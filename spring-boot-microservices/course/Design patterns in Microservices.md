# Design Patterns of Microservices
|S.No | #Pattern  | #Intent |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|1 | Aggregator | Collects releated items of data and displays them based on DRY principle |
| 2| API Gateway | 1. It can convert the protocol request from one type to other 2. API gateway acts as an entry point to forward the client requests to appropriate microservices  |
|3 | Chained or Chain of Responsibility |  |
| 4| Asynchronous Messaging |  |
| 5| Database or Shared Data |  |
|6 | Event Sourcing |  |
| 7| Branch |  |
| 8| Command Query Responsibility Segregator |  |
|9 | Circuit Breaker |  |
|10 | Decomposition |  |
