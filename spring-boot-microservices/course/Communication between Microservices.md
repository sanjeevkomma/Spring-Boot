# To Read
* Synchronous communication = In this pattern, a service calls an API that another service exposes, using a protocol such as HTTP or gRPC. This option is a synchronous messaging pattern because the caller waits for a response from the receiver
* Asynchronous message passing = In this pattern, a service sends message without waiting for a response, and one or more services process the message asynchronously
