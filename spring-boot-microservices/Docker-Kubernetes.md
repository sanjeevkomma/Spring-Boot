# Definition
* Docker = Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production
* Kubernetes = Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available


# Docker : To Read
* Docker image contains everything a micro service needs to run. ( for ex : 1) Application runtime ( JDK, Python, NodeJS ) 2) Application code 3) dependencies ) 
* We can install / run docker container on 1) on-premise (local machine) 2) corporate data center 3) cloud
* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the world's easiest way to create, manage and deliver your container applications. It contains number of repositories.
* We will deploy Docker container inside Kubernetes Cluster 
* OpenShift is Container Platform ( PAAS --- Platform As A Service )  
* OpenShift is Kubernetes Platform 
* Katacoda editor 
* Pod = Memory Usage + CPU Usage + Filesystem + Network In + Network Out 
* Application Isolation
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Docker = Used to containerize the micro services
* Kubernetes = Used to orchestrate the micro services
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/08_using_compose/) is a tool
* docker commands are focused on only one container (or image) at once while docker-compose manage several containers docker
* Docker Image = Docker Container
* Docker Desktop includes Docker Engine and Kubernetes
* Image is like a Class and Container is like an Object
* For one Image, we can have any number of Containers running
* Image is static version and Container is running version of image
* We have to publish container port ( for ex : 5000 ) to host port ( for ex : 5000 ) for running & accessing application using docker in local
* Docker Image contains JDK , Application Jar, Libraries, Dependant Libraries , Softwares etc that are need to run the Container on Docker Engine
* Cloud providers ( AWS, Azure, GCP ) provide container based services
* AWS provides a service called "Elastic Container Service" for Docker
* Azure provides a service called "Azure Container Service" for Docker
* Docker official Images are curated set of docker repositories hosted on Docker Hub
* Spring-Boot creates the docker image using Spring Boot maven plugin configured in pom.xml

# Terminology
* Docker
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) = Container Orchestration
* Kubernetes VS Docker
* Docker Registry = [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
* Docker Repository = sanjeevkomma/todo-rest-api-h2
* Docker Tag = 1.0.0.RELEASE
* Image = A Static Template -- A Set of Bytes = [ It contains JDK , Application Jar, Libraries, Dependant Libraries , Softwares etc that are need to run the Container on Docker Engine] 
* Container = Running version of the Image
* Host Port : Container Port = -p 5000 : 5000
* Docker Desktop = Docker Client + Docker Daemon ( Docker Engine )
* Docker Client = 
* Docker Daemon = Docker Enginen 
* Orchestration = Arrangement
* Automation
* Container Based Applications =
* Seamlessly = Continuously
* Route = Route is basically an URL through which you can access the application 
* Pod = Each Pod can have one or more Containers
* Node
* Cluster = Group
* Virtual Machine
* Physical Machine
* Platform

# Kubernetes (K8s) : To Read
* Kubernetes is cloud neutral 
* Kubernetes leverages the simplicity of Platform as a Service (PaaS) when used on the Cloud
* A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node


# Terminology
* Kubernetes Cluster = Group of Servers that are managed together
* Cloud Neutral = 
* Node =
