| Concept           | **JWT (JSON Web Token)**                                                    | **Encryption**                                                             |

| **Definition**    | A compact, URL-safe token format for securely transmitting claims           | A method to convert readable data (plaintext) into unreadable (ciphertext) |
| **Purpose**       | Identity, claims, or authorization sharing (can be signed and/or encrypted) | Protect confidentiality by preventing unauthorized access to data          |
| **Types**         | ✅ **JWS** (Signed), ✅ **JWE** (Encrypted)                                   | Symmetric (AES), Asymmetric (RSA, ECC)                                     |
| **Focus**         | Authentication / Authorization tokens                                       | Data confidentiality and privacy                                           |
| **Readable?**     | Yes, **if not encrypted** (base64-encoded payload is human-readable)        | No – ciphertext is not readable without decryption                         |
| **Tamper Proof?** | Yes, if signed (JWS)                                                        | Not inherently – encryption protects data, not integrity                   |
| **Use With JWT**  | ✅ JWTs are often signed using HMAC or RSA/ECDSA                             | ✅ JWTs can also be encrypted (JWE)                                         |

# JWT Examples
# 1. Signed JWT (JWS)
* Header: algorithm info (e.g., RS256)
* Payload: claims (e.g., user info, expiration)
* Signature: generated using private key or shared secret
* **Use Case:** Verifying identity, passing authorization info
  * Readable? Yes
  * Secure? Only if signature is verified
# 2. Encrypted JWT (JWE) 
* Encrypts payload and optionally the header
* Requires recipient to decrypt before accessing claims
* **Use Case:** Protecting sensitive information (like emails, roles)
  * Readable? No
  * Secure? Yes, contents hidden from unauthorized viewers
# Real-World Use Case
* A login flow might:
  1. Authenticate user
  2. Generate a signed JWT (JWS) with user claims
  3. Optionally encrypt the JWT (JWE) if it contains sensitive data
  4. Send it to the client
  5. Client sends it in future API requests
  6. Resource server decrypts (if needed) and verifies the signature
