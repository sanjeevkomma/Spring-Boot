| Feature                | **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**                                            | **OAuth (Open Authorization)**                                                          |

| **Purpose**            | Authentication + Directory lookup                                                           | Authorization (delegated access)                                                        |
| **Protocol Type**      | Protocol for accessing directory services                                                   | Authorization framework                                                                 |
| **Use Case**           | Internal systems, user authentication from a centralized directory (e.g., Active Directory) | Granting third-party apps access to user data without sharing credentials               |
| **Authentication**     | Yes – often used for authentication (bind request with username/password)                   | No – typically used for authorization, but works with authentication via OpenID Connect |
| **Authorization**      | Basic (role/group-based via directory attributes)                                           | Yes – fine-grained, token-based access control                                          |
| **Where Used**         | Enterprise environments (Intranet, corporate login)                                         | Web apps, mobile apps, APIs, cloud-based systems                                        |
| **Data Storage**       | Centralized directory (stores users, roles, groups, etc.)                                   | No storage – delegates to other identity providers                                      |
| **Token-Based?**       | No – uses username/password                                                                 | Yes – uses access tokens, refresh tokens, etc.                                          |
| **Standard Ports**     | TCP 389 (LDAP), TCP 636 (LDAPS)                                                             | Uses HTTPS (port 443)                                                                   |
| **Modern Web Support** | Limited (older, not optimized for REST/JSON)                                                | Fully supported (modern RESTful, JSON-based APIs)                                       |
