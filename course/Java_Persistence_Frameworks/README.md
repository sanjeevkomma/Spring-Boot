# Java Persistence Frameworks Comparison

## 1. JPA (Java Persistence API)

**What is it?**  
- A **specification** for object-relational mapping in Java.
- Does **not provide implementation** itself.

**Key Features**:
- Standardized API
- Annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`
- JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)
- Caching and lifecycle callbacks

**Popular Implementations**:
- Hibernate
- EclipseLink
- OpenJPA

---

## 2. Hibernate

**What is it?**  
- Most widely used **JPA implementation**.
- Also functions as a standalone ORM.

**Key Features**:
- JPA support
- Lazy/eager loading
- First/second-level caching
- HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
- Criteria API

**Use Cases**:
- Full-featured ORM in Spring Boot (`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`)

---

## 3. iBatis (Deprecated)

**What is it?**  
- Older SQL mapping tool, now replaced by MyBatis.
- Used XML-based mapping for SQL to objects.

---

## 4. MyBatis

**What is it?**  
- SQL-centric persistence framework.
- You write the SQL, it maps results to objects.

**Key Features**:
- Lightweight and simple
- Annotations or XML mapping
- Integration with Spring (`mybatis-spring`)

**Use Cases**:
- Fine-grained SQL control
- Legacy or complex queries

---

## 5. EclipseLink

**What is it?**  
- Official JPA reference implementation by Eclipse Foundation.

**Features**:
- JPA 2.x support
- EclipseLink MOXy for XML binding

---

## 6. OpenJPA

**What is it?**  
- Apacheâ€™s JPA implementation.
- Less popular compared to Hibernate or EclipseLink.

---

## 7. Spring Data JPA

**What is it?**  
- Spring abstraction layer over JPA.
- Uses Hibernate by default.

**Key Features**:
- Repository interfaces (`CrudRepository`, `JpaRepository`)
- Query derivation, paging, sorting
- Native queries

---

## 8. JOOQ (Java Object Oriented Querying)

**What is it?**  
- Type-safe, SQL-centric Java persistence.
- Generates Java classes from DB schema.

**Use Cases**:
- Complex SQL with Java safety

---

## 9. Apache Cayenne

**What is it?**  
- Full-featured open-source ORM.
- Offers visual modeling tools.

---

## 10. TopLink (Oracle)

**What is it?**  
- Original ORM from Oracle.
- Basis for EclipseLink.

---

## 11. Micronaut Data / Quarkus Panache

**What is it?**  
- Modern persistence layers in Micronaut and Quarkus.
- Focus on compile-time optimizations.
