# Cookie
* A cookie is a small text file that a website can store on a user's device. It is sent along with each HTTP request to the website and can be used to store user preferences, login credentials, or other data. Cookies can be either session cookies, which are deleted when the user closes their browser, or persistent cookies, which are stored on the user's device for a longer period of time

# Session
* A session is a way to maintain stateful information between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. When a user visits a website, the server creates a unique session ID and sends it to the client in the form of a cookie. The client sends this session ID with each subsequent request, and the server uses it to associate the request with the user's session data. Session data is typically stored on the server and can include information such as user preferences, shopping cart items, or authentication tokens

# Token
* A token is a piece of data that is used to authenticate a user or provide access to a protected resource. Tokens can be generated by a server and sent to a client, which can then include the token with subsequent requests to prove their identity. Tokens can be used for various purposes, such as providing access to an API, authorizing a user's access to a resource, or maintaining a user's login state. Tokens can be stored on the client or the server, depending on the specific use case
