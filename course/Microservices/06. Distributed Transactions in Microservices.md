# Definition
* Distributed Transaction = A distributed transaction is a set of operations on data that is performed across two or more data repositories (especially databases)

# To Read
* Because microservices are distributed and microservices communicate with each other by inter-service communication on network level.
* Each microservice has its own instance and process.
* Therefore, services must interact using an inter-service communication protocols like HTTP, gRPC or message brokers AMQP protocol

# Patterns for handling distributed transactions in microservices
* In microservices architectures, handling transactions that span multiple services is a complex challenge because microservices typically maintain their own databases and cannot rely on traditional ACID transactions across distributed systems.
* This is where distributed transaction patterns come into play
# 1. Saga Design Pattern
* Saga is Asynchronous and Reactive
   1. Choreography-based Saga ( event-driven )
   2. Orchestration-based Saga
# 2. 2pc (two-phase commit)
* The Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol is a traditional approach for distributed transactions, but it has significant drawbacks in microservices due to its complexity and performance penalties
* **How It Works:**
* In the first phase (prepare phase), the coordinator asks all services (participants) if they are ready to commit the transaction.
* If all services vote to commit, the second phase (commit phase) begins, and the coordinator sends a commit message to all participants.
* **Pros:** Ensures strong consistency
* **Cons:** Poor performance due to blocking, risk of long delays if a service is unavailable, doesn't scale well with microservices architectures.
* 2PC is Synchronous. 2PC has two phases:
  1. **Prepare phase** -- during this phase, all participants of the transaction prepare for commit and notify the coordinator that they are ready to complete the transaction
  2. **Commit or Rollback phase** -- during this phase, either a commit or a rollback command is issued by the transaction coordinator to all participants
* **Example with Spring Boot:**
    * Spring Boot doesn't directly support 2PC, but you can use tools like Atomikos or Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM) to coordinate distributed transactions with JTA (Java Transaction API).
# 3. Eventual Consistency with Event Sourcing
* Eventual consistency ensures that all services will eventually be consistent, even if some services take longer than others to complete their tasks.
* A. Event Sourcing
  * How It Works: Each service stores its state as a sequence of events, rather than as a direct update to the database. The events are propagated across microservices, which react to them accordingly.
  * Pros: Provides a complete audit trail of every change, natural fit for distributed systems.
  * Cons: Eventual consistency means there may be a temporary delay before all services reflect the same state
  * Use Spring Boot with Axon Framework or Eventuate for event sourcing.
* B. Outbox Pattern
* The Outbox pattern ensures that the changes made by a service and the event emitted as a result of those changes are treated as a single atomic operation
  * How It Works: Changes are written to an "outbox" table in the same transaction as the data modification. A separate process reads the outbox table and publishes events
  * Pros: Ensures eventual consistency without losing events.
  * Cons: Requires additional infrastructure to handle outbox processing.
* Use Debezium or implement your own polling mechanism to publish events from the outbox table.
# 4. TCC (Try-Confirm/Cancel)
* The Try-Confirm/Cancel (TCC) pattern is a distributed transaction model where each service provides three operations: try, confirm, and cancel. This approach is similar to 2PC but without the blocking
  * Try: Reserve resources.
  * Confirm: Commit the transaction.
  * Cancel: Roll back or release resources.
  * Pros: Ensures strong consistency without blocking.
  * Cons: Complexity of implementing the try, confirm, and cancel steps in each service.
* Example with Spring Boot: Each service will implement these three stages (try, confirm, cancel) using REST APIs or messaging.
# 5. Compensating Transactions
* If the system doesn't support distributed transactions, you can handle failures by using compensating transactions, which are essentially manual rollbacks of a transaction if something goes wrong.
  * How It Works: When a failure occurs, the system manually calls a service to undo the effects of the previous steps.
  * Pros: Works with eventual consistency, easier to implement
  * Cons: Requires careful management of compensating actions and may lead to temporary inconsistencies.
* Example with Spring Boot: If an order is created but payment fails, the compensating action would cancel the order and refund the user.
# Conclusion
* In Spring Boot microservices, managing distributed transactions requires using patterns like Saga, eventual consistency, TCC, or 2PC.
* The choice of pattern depends on the trade-offs between consistency, complexity, performance, and fault tolerance.
* The Saga pattern (either choreography or orchestration) is the most popular approach for distributed transactions due to its scalability and alignment with microservice architecture principles.
