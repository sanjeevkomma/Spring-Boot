# Architecture
* RPC-style, service calls look like invoking functions (userService.getUser(id)).
* Requires a Thrift compiler to generate client/server code from an IDL (Interface Definition Language)
# Performance
* Very efficient due to binary serialization.
* Great for low-latency, high-throughput internal microservices.
