# Architecture
* RPC-style, service calls look like invoking functions (userService.getUser(id)).
* Requires a Thrift compiler to generate client/server code from an IDL (Interface Definition Language)
# Performance
* Very efficient due to binary serialization.
* Great for low-latency, high-throughput internal microservices.
# Flexibility and Compatibility
* Strong typing and versioning support.
* Clients need code regeneration if IDL changes.
# Use Cases

# Tooling and Ecosystem
* Thrift: Requires thrift compiler, runtime libraries per language.
* REST: No special compiler needed; huge ecosystem (Swagger, Postman, etc.).
