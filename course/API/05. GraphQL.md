What is GraphQL? Is it a replacement for the REST API?

The diagram below shows the quick comparison between REST and GraphQL.

🔹GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Meta. It provides a complete description of the data in the API and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need.

🔹GraphQL servers sit in between the client and the backend services.

🔹GraphQL can aggregate multiple REST requests into one query. GraphQL server organizes the resources in a graph.

🔹GraphQL supports queries, mutations (applying data modifications to resources), and subscriptions (receiving notifications on schema modifications).

We talked about the REST API in last week’s video and will compare REST vs. GraphQL vs. gRPC in a separate post/video.

Over to you:
1). Is GraphQL a database technology?
2). Do you recommend GraphQL? Why/why not?

# Advantages
1. GraphQL is more precise, accurate, and efficient
* To avoid data over fetching & data under fetching by REST API
2. Retrieve many resources from a single request
3. It facilitates you to deal with many databases efficiently
4. Data can be fetched using a single API call
5. Using GraphQL, you can discover the schema in the appropriate format

# GraphiQL
* GraphiQL is an interactive web-based IDE (tool) for testing and exploring GraphQL APIs.
* Think of it as:
    * Postman — but specifically for GraphQL.
