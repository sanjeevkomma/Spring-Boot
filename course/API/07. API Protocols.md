# ToRead
📌1. REST (Representational State Transfer)
REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on stateless communication using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Data is typically exchanged in formats like JSON or XML.

📌2. Webhooks
Webhooks are a mechanism for one system to notify another system asynchronously when a specific event occurs, by sending an HTTP POST request to a predefined URL.

📌3. GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching. It provides a flexible and efficient way to interact with APIs.


📌4. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services via XML. It supports complex operations, messaging, and has built-in error handling.


📌5. WebSocket
WebSocket provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data exchange with low latency.


📌6. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
MQTT is a lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks, often used in IoT environments.


📌7. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers for serialization, and provides features like bidirectional streaming.


📌8. EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)
EDI is a standardized method for exchanging business documents (like purchase orders and invoices) electronically between organizations.

📌9. EDA (Event-Driven Architecture)
EDA involves designing systems around the generation, detection, and consumption of events, enabling real-time responsiveness.

📌10. SSE (Server-Sent Events)
Full Description: SSE allows servers to push automatic updates to clients over HTTP, maintaining a persistent connection.

📌11. AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)
AMQP is an open standard for passing messages between systems, supporting reliable messaging, queuing, and flexible routing.

📌12. gRPC (again for emphasis)
Same as above, high-performance RPC suitable for microservices and internal APIs.
