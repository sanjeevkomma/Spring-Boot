|1 | Singleton pattern |1. The singleton pattern is a mechanism that ensures only one instance of an object exists per application 2. This pattern can be useful when managing shared resources or providing cross-cutting services, such as logging 3. Spring restricts a singleton to one object per Spring IoC container.  |
|2 | Factory Method pattern |The factory method pattern uses a factory class with an abstract method for creating the desired object.  |
|3 | Proxy pattern | The proxy pattern is a technique that allows one object — the proxy — to control access to another object — the subject or service |
|4 | Template Method pattern | 1. The template method pattern is a technique that defines the steps required for some action, implementing the boilerplate steps, and leaving the customizable steps as abstract 2. Subclasses can then implement this abstract class and provide a concrete implementation for the missing steps |
